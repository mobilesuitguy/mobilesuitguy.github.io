<p>With Anime Expo 2016 right around the corner, some cosplay plans are due for publishing!</p>

<img src="/images/AnimeExpo2016Post.jpg" alt="Anime Expo 2016 Cosplay Plans">

<p>I'll be cosplaying for Aniplex USA and Bandai Namco through American Cosplay Paradise this year as GGO Kirito and Kousei Arima at Anime Expo 2016! Come check us out at the Aniplex and Bandai Namco booth or at our various events at the convention. Outside of my duties, I'll be hanging around Anime Expo as Idol Kirito or Emiya Shirou :)</p>

<p>Every purchase at the Aniplex Booth comes a free 18" by 24" poster! There will be five designs out there so make sure to pick one up while supplies last!</p>
