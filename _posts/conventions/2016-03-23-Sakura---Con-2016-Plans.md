<p>Here's the low-down of what's happening with me at Aniplex for Sakura-Con 2016!</p>

<p>I'll be at each event in its respective costume, so make sure to say hi and ask for a cosplay card. Fresh off the press :)</p>

<p>Also, if you show up for the Sword Art Online Movie event on Saturday 2 PM to 4 PM, you'll get an exclusive mini poster done by the original character designer for Sword Art Online, Abec. Be there!</p>

<p>P.S. I'll be at the Aniplex booth all three days at select times, but you can grab the exclusive Sword Art Online calendar from the booth at any time. Get them early because they might not be there later in the day~</p>
