<p>Day Two of Sakura-Con! Today was SAO day for me, with the Sword Art Online Ordinal Scale movie hype panel and my shift at the Aniplex Booth, so I got all strapped up in my Gun Gale Online Kirito cosplay and headed over to the convention!</p>

<p>I didn't really have much planned for the early morning on that day so for the most part I walked around the exhibitor's hall, introducing myself to some fellow booth staff, some of whom I've known over Twitter, like <a href="https://twitter.com/milesexpress999">Miles</a>, but have never met in person. Speaking of Miles, I recall that on Day 2 of Sakura-Con that they were able to get their booth at Crunchyroll set up, which I can imagine was a huge relief.</p>

<p>I ended up going over to the autograph area to help the other cosplayers with the Sword Art Online signing. The line for it was LONG. Like SUPER long.</p>

<p>I headed up to the movie panel room early to get set up for the movie panel. Among our SAO cosplay team for the panel, including myself, were <a href="https://twitter.com/agsmacosplay">AGSMA Cosplay</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/marinanc1">Ryu</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kimixkimi">Kimi</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ABlackSwordsman">AndrewBlackSwordsman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CeltyFarron">CeltyFarron</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/atashi000">Atashi</a>. If a Sakura-Con attendee went to the Ordinal Scale SAO movie preview panel, they would have received a really cool, limited print mini-poster with art from the Ordinal Scale movie itself.</p>

<p>The panel itself was a blast. Our cosplay team handed out posters to every attendee who walked through the door and with it, we included a raffle ticket for prizes to be drawn near the end of the panel. When the panel got closer to starting, we readied ourselves to escort the guests to the stage.</p>

 <p>Reki Kawahara was assigned to our two Silicas and was escorted to the stage with AGSMA Cosplay's Kagemitsu G4 prop and Pina Plushie on his hand and head. I was assigned to Abec, whom I've had the opportunity to meet before from volunteering with ACParadise (along with the rest of the guests on the panel). Abec is suuuper funny and was able to make the entire room laugh with live illustrations during the panel. Finally, Kazuma Miki and Shinichiro Kashiwada were escorted by our panel team's Kirito and Asuna.</p>

<p>After the escorting was done, our cosplay team returned to their seats and sat with the rest of the fans to enjoy the panel. Character designs and concept art were revealed, some details of the "Augma" augmented reality device was talked about, there was a Q & A portion during the panel, with Abec drawing the whole time of course, and a video with Bryce Papenbrook and Cherami Leigh joking about what they think Ordinal Scale could be about. At the end of the panel, there were some really sweet looking prizes that were raffled out to the general attendees. Many of which were signed by the guests themselves!</p>

<p>After the panel, I went back to the Aniplex booth for my shift there and that lasted until it was time for the exhibitor's hall to close. When the exhibitor hall closed, I went back to my hotel room where I got changed into some non-cosplay attire. I kind of wanted to go back to the convention to check out the BAND-MAID live performance, but it was a little too late at that point. Instead, I went out to hang with some friends at GameWorks and at Sakura-Con's 'Not-Rave,' sleeping promptly afterward to get ready for the last day of Sakura-Con 2016.</p>
