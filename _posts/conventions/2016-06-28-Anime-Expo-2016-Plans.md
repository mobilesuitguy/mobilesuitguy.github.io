<p>I'll be volunteering with Aniplex and Bandai Namco for Anime Expo 2016 this year, so here's the gist of what I'll be doing during then!</p>

<p>I'll be in mostly GGO Kirito for each event, so make sure to say hi and ask for a cosplay card!</p>

<p>Also, stop by the Aniplex booth to vote for your favorite character and receive a button!</p>

<p>While you're at the Aniplex booth, go ahead and pick up a free Anime Expo 2016 exclusive Aniplex Calendar on us!</p>

<p>P.S. I'll be at the Aniplex booth for the latter of the four days at select times and the Bandai Namco booth for the first two days, but you can grab the exclusive Sword Art Online calendar from the booth at any time. Get them early because they might not be there later in the day~</p>
