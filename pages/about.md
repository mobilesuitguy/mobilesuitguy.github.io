<p>Hey, I'm Mike and MobileSuitGuy is my cosplay alias! In my spare time watch anime, read manga, and play video games. I also enjoy comics and tv content, mostly of the superhero variety. My first convention was Sakura-Con 2011 and ever since then, I've gone to conventions every year. Be sure to follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/MobileSuitGuy" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://facebook.com/MobileSuitGuy" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, and <a href="https://instagram.com/MobileSuitGuy" target="_blank">Instagram</a> for more frequent updates and content.</p>

<p>I first started cosplaying at Sakura-Con 2012 as Roy Mustang from Fullmetal Alchemist. Since then, I've enjoyed cosplaying with friends, volunteering, and just having a good time in general. Currently, I attend a university in the Pacific Northwest and work part-time as a Server Administrator.</p>

<p>I've been volunteering ever since I was in middle school, though for non-convention related work. After going to Sakura-Con and having such a wonderful experience, I felt that I could do more to build up the community that has made me the person I am today. As a result, I took up volunteering through <a href="http://sakuracon.org">ANCEA/Sakura-Con</a> as a member of their Logistics and Publicity divisions. Both were fantastic experiences and the people I worked with were just as enthusiastic about the work as I was if not more.</p>

<p>In the past few years, I've volunteered with <a href="http://acparadise.com">American Cosplay Paradise</a>, and through them I felt like I could get the most out of my convention experience, balancing volunteer work and my passion for Japanese pop culture in the United States. The staff at ACParadise are really kind and amazing folk. Because of them, I was able to have the opportunity to promote series that I love and to meet incredibly talented individuals.</p>
